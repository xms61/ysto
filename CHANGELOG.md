## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-25

### Changed
- Covers come from AnimeThemes' own images, not AniList. The sync asks for `images`, and `catalog:covers` downloads the large cover (or else the small one), named after the AnimeThemes anime id. With a dump, which has no cover links, the step explains that and stops.
- The AniList query no longer asks for cover images: only the fields the game uses, in line with AniList's terms.
- The plan records the owner's decisions on AniList use and covers (Q16).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- The catalog build (`scripts/catalog/`), one command per step:
  - `catalog:sync-animethemes`: AnimeThemes metadata from the API, or `--from-dump`
  - `catalog:scan-audio`: durations with ffprobe
  - `catalog:enrich-anilist`: titles, genres, popularity, the adult flag and relations, fetched in paced batches
  - `catalog:covers`: optional, and on hold until the cover source is decided
  - `catalog:build`: writes `catalog.sqlite` and prints a review report
  - `catalog:check`: the gate for matching, popularity, the adult filter and loudness
- Every step caches its work and resumes after an interruption. The assembly is a pure function, so the same inputs give the same catalog.
- The catalog schema in `server/catalog/schema.ts`, and the generated `docs/generated/catalog-schema.md`.
- `YSTO_AUDIO_DIR`, `YSTO_CATALOG_DIR`, `YSTO_CACHE_DIR` and `YSTO_FFMPEG_PATH`, read by `loadCatalogConfig` in `server/config.ts`.
- Tests for every step: a fake HTTP client instead of the network, and ffmpeg-generated tones instead of the library.
- The area doc `scripts/catalog/CATALOG.md`, and a README section on building the catalog.

### Changed
- ESLint allows `node:sqlite` only in `server/catalog/` and `scripts/catalog/`, and `process.env` only in `server/config.ts`, now also for the scripts.
- Coverage includes `scripts/catalog/`, and the CI `app` job installs ffmpeg for the audio tests.
- The catalog design doc describes the build as implemented, including the gate's thresholds. SECURITY.md records AniList's and AnimeThemes' terms.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- `LICENSE`: Apache License 2.0, also set in `package.json`, with a License section in the README.
- A "Before a release" step in the release process: the doc-gardening pass.

### Changed
- Doc gardening runs before each release, not weekly.
- The release process and SECURITY.md say that new high or critical CodeQL alerts block merges to `main`.
- The v1 plan records M0 as done, with the owner's answers on license, merging and gardening.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- Design docs: system design, anti-cheat and score integrity, catalog, audio clips and playback, hosting and deploy.
- Product specs: game flow, questions and options, scoring, lobby, settings.
- A documentation and credits section in the README.

### Changed
- SECURITY, RELIABILITY, PRODUCT_SENSE and DESIGN are now drafts, no longer stubs.
- The v1 plan links to the docs that own each part of the design, and keeps only the milestones, progress and decisions.
- The README no longer has the template's setup section.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- App scaffold:
  - an Express 5 server (`server/`) with `/healthz`, which serves the built client and falls back to it for client-side routes such as join links
  - a React 19 client built by Vite 8, with Tailwind CSS 4 (`src/`)
- Tooling:
  - TypeScript 6.0, with separate configs for the client and for Node
  - ESLint 10, with the layer rules and a single reader of env vars, plus Prettier
  - Node's test runner with coverage thresholds, Vitest with Testing Library, and a Playwright smoke test in Chromium and WebKit
- CI jobs `app` (`npm run test:ci` and the build) and `e2e` (the smoke test), and Dependabot for npm.

### Changed
- Prettier formats the doc and tracked-files scripts.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- `scripts/check-tracked-files.mjs`, with tests, keeps the public repo clean. It blocks media, databases, metadata dumps, env files, keys and files over 1 MiB. It also blocks text that reveals this machine: home-folder paths and the local user or host name. A pre-commit hook in `.githooks/` runs it on staged files.
- gitleaks in CI, pinned by version and checksum, with an extra rule for home-folder paths (`.gitleaks.toml`).
- An allowlist `.dockerignore`, so new data folders stay out of images.
- Dependabot updates for the SHA-pinned actions.

### Changed
- CI runs on every pull request and every push to `main`, and its actions are pinned by commit SHA.
- `.gitignore` also covers audio and video files, metadata dumps and more key formats.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- Repository setup: agent doc map (`AGENTS.md`), code style, testing and release docs, CI.
- Knowledge base: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, design docs, product specs, exec plans, topic docs, and `scripts/check-docs.mjs`, which CI runs to enforce links, frontmatter, indexes and plan sections.
