## [0.12.1] - 2026-09-30

### Changed
- The v1 plan and DEPLOY.md record that the covers are converted to WebP and the catalog is rebuilt from the live AnimeThemes API, ready for the first upload.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-30

### Changed
- Covers are stored as WebP, at most 600 px wide and never enlarged. `npm run catalog:covers` converts the covers already on disk once, then downloads new ones in the same format; `npm run catalog:build` afterwards records the new file names. A sample shrank to about 29 % of its size, most covers at full resolution.
- Browsers keep covers for a day, so a cover that comes back in a game isn't fetched again.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed
- A crossover that AnimeThemes files under several series (Isekai Quartet, Kaginado) no longer merges those franchises into one, which Hard mode would have treated as a single franchise.

### Changed
- The catalog is built from a live AnimeThemes sync instead of the September dump: franchises now use AnimeThemes series, titles gain their synonyms, and reveals show cover art.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- A Docker image: Node 24 on Alpine with ffmpeg, run as a non-root user with a health check, and without npm, corepack or yarn.
- `deploy/`: the VPS's compose file, with Caddy serving HTTPS on the domain in `YSTO_DOMAIN` and the game hardened behind it (read-only, no capabilities, no published port), a Caddyfile, and a `.env.example`.
- `npm run catalog:export`: re-encodes every file the catalog plays to 128 kbps Opus in `YSTO_EXPORT_DIR` for the VPS. Reruns encode only new or changed files and remove copies no longer played.
- The release workflow, started by hand from main: reruns CI, publishes the image for amd64 and arm64 to GHCR with an SBOM and provenance, tags the version and creates the GitHub release.
- A `docker` CI job: builds the image, runs it on the fixture catalog until it is ready, cuts clips in it, checks that it holds no audio or database file, and scans it with Trivy.
- `docs/DEPLOY.md`, the runbook for the Hetzner VPS, the library upload, releases and rollbacks.
- `robots.txt`, which disallows everything.

### Changed
- The browser tests' fixture catalog is written by `e2e/fixture-data.ts`, which the image check uses too.
- Dependabot also keeps the base image and Caddy digests current.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-09-30

### Changed
- M6 is done: a whole game on a real iPhone played every clip, at the 15% default volume and with the silent switch on. The v1 plan and the audio clips doc record the check.
