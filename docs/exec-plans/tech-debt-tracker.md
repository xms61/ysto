# Tech debt tracker

Known shortcuts and gaps, written down so they are paid off on purpose instead of rediscovered. Add a row when you take on or find debt; delete the row in the change that pays it off (git keeps the history).

| Debt | Where | Cost of leaving it | Found | Plan |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| TypeScript is pinned to 6.0.x, because typescript-eslint supports TypeScript below 6.1 | `package.json`, `.github/dependabot.yml` | Typechecks miss the speed of TypeScript 7's native compiler | 2026-09-25 | Move to TypeScript 7 once typescript-eslint supports it, and drop the Dependabot ignore |
